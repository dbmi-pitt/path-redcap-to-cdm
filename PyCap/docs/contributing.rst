Issues & Contributing
=====================

If you have an issue with PyCap or the REDCap API, please raise an issue on PyCap's `issues page <http://github.com/sburns/PyCap/issues>`_. I'll do my best to help where I can.

PyCap follows the `Fork-Pull workflow <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests#fork--pull>`_ method for accepting contributions. If you'd like to contribute code to PyCap, please use the following workflow:

1. If you don't already have an account on GitHub, please make one.
2. Fork `my repo <http://github.com/sburns/PyCap>`_ to your own account.
3. Checkout a branch & commit your changes. Tests are definitely appreciated!
4. Push those changes to your repo & submit a Pull-Request to my repository.

If any of these steps are unclear, please peruse the helpful `GitHub Guide on Forking <https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/>`_ or reach out to me on `Twitter <http://twitter.com/scottsburns>`_.
