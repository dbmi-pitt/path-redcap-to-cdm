Release 1.1

For release 1.1, you need to update 2 tables: REDCAP_PATIENT_MAPPING and PRO_CM:

- In REDCAP_PATIENT_MAPPING change PATID datatype from NUMBER to VARCHAR2(50).  For SQL Server, change it to VARCHAR(50).  Note: you may need to truncate the table before you change the data type.  Save the data before truncating.
- In PRO_CM add a column called DATE_MISSING VARCHAR2(1).  For SQL Server, make the data type VARCHAR(1).

The files in the sql_files directory incorporate these changes.
